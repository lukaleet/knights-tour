# knights-tour
Program to solve chess theory problem - knights tour. Made with javascript and html

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square, the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.

Program implements Warnsdorff rule in order to find proper paths. In case of fields with the same weight it chooses one of them randomly.

Program allow you to choose few starting options: drawing path, listing order of visited fields, delay between knight's jump
